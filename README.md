# Movie Recommender System

A machine learning-based recommendation engine that suggests movies based on similar genres, plots, and cast members. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze movie metadata and interactive web deployment for the user interface.

###  Project Overview
* **Goal:** To build a content-based recommendation system that solves the "cold start" problem (suggesting items without user history).
* **Dataset:** TMDB 1300 Movie Dataset.

###  Features
* **Smart Recommendations:** Suggests 5 similar movies based on content tags.
* **Poster Integration:** Fetches real-time movie posters using the TMDB API.
* **Interactive UI:** A clean, responsive web interface built with Streamlit.
* **Optimized Performance:** Uses a "Lite" model version for fast cloud deployment.

###  Tech Stack
* **Python** (Logic & Data Processing)
* **Pandas** (Data Cleaning & Manipulation)
* **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning & Vectorization)
* **Streamlit** (Web Application Framework)
* **TMDB API** (Real-time Image Fetching)
